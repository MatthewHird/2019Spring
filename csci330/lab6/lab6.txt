*** state/global ***

GlobalConst: 0x55983b47aa14
GlobalVar: 0x55983b67b040
staticVar: 0x55983b67b044

All global and static variables appear in the state/global memory area.


*** heap ***

malloc ptr: 0x55983cfb5010

The heap seems to be right after the state and global vars. It contains pointers


*** runtime stack ***

mainVar: 0x7fff37ebc3ac
mainConst: 0x7fff37ebc3a8

argc: 0x7fff37ebc39c
argv: 0x7fff37ebc390

localVar: 0x7fff37ebc374
localConst: 0x7fff37ebc370

loopVar: 0x7fff37ebc36c
loopConst: 0x7fff37ebc368

All nonstatic namespace specific vars (including argc and argv) are put on the
runtime stack. The start of the stack seems to be arbitrarily assigned by the
compiler, and is at the bottom of the program. As the stack builds up, 
the memory addresses count downwards.
