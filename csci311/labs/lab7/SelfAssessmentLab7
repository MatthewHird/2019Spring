Specifications:

• Clear the word from the div when a button is pressed
    I made it clear the words and reset the style in the div when the button is
    clicked. It was unclear from the video or document whether the style was also 
    supposed to be reset. 
• Skew the div, and transition the colours when a button is pressed
    In the video, the text colour changed when the first colour was selected, so
    I made it so in mine the div backgound colour changes when the first colour
    is selected. Then when the button is pressed, it transitions to the second 
    colour.
• Skew degrees: use javascript to verify the value is within range when 
  the button, below is pressed.
    I set the min and max values on the input, so the up and down buttons won't
    go outside the range, but the user can still type in values outside of the 
    min and max ranges. I do have Javascript that validates the values are 
    within range when the "Transform Text" button is pressed.

Additional HTML Page:

    I took an object oriented approach to my JavaScript, and built the transformer
form+functions as a class. The class constructor takes in 2 parameters, the form's
id value and the text display box's id value, and uses CSS selectors to determine
the IDs of different elements throughout the form. The selectors us the form ID,
followed by a class selector, followed by the element type to determine certain
elements' IDs (e.g. "#formId .imageDisplay img" to get the list of image elements
to be displayed). 

    This means I could put multiple independent transformation forms 
that don't interfer with each other on a single HTML page without writing any 
additional JavaScript (except a second constructor call) and without hard coding
any ID's in the JavaScript script. Just as a proof of concept to my self, I tested
and have included an extra HTML page with 2 independently functioning transformation
forms.
